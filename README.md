# Splash of Colour  
En: Colour Splash Effect  
Kr: 컬러추출필터  
Cn: 局部彩色  

This is a technique that remains specific colour tone while making every others monochrome.  
Main theme of my implementation is use of Bilateral K-means clustering (which simply means k = 2) after RGB -> YCbCr Conversion. For K-means clustering, I didn't consider Y (luminence value).
