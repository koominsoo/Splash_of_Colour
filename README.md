# Splash of Colour
Splash of Colour, in other name, colour extraction (in Korean, 컬러 추출 효과) is a technique that remains specific colour tone while making every others monochrome.  
Main theme of my implementation this time, is the use of Bilateral K-means clustering (which simply means k = 2) after RGB -> YCbCr Conversion.
