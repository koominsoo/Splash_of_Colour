# Splash of Colour  
Eng: Colour Splash Effect  
Kor: 컬러추출 필터  
Chn: 局部彩色  

This is a technique that remains specific colour tone while making every others monochrome.  
Main theme of my implementation this time, is the use of Bilateral K-means clustering (which simply means k = 2) after RGB -> YCbCr Conversion.
